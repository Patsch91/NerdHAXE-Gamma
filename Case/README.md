# Case 
- **3D-printed parts:** You can find the files in here 
- **M3 inserts:** I used threaded nuts (M3) to hold the parts together 
- **PEM:** Power entry module with fuse and switch to cut the power without pulling any other connections
- **Screws:** this design is made for M3 screws 
- **Fans:** I am using 2x Noctua A9x25 PWM chromax fans in a push-pull configuration, and at 80% PWM, the sound level is quite pleasant. The Arctic P9 Max are working very well with much headroom but at a higher noise level
- **PSU:** Meanwell UHP-200-12. <br>



# Misc 
**DISCLAIMER:** This device is an *advanced* build and partly WIP. To get 6 Asics soldered properly *can* be very hard and frustrating if you are not used to soldering Asics or soldering in general. Using that amount of power, this device is not a toy, and you should know what you are doing. Follow the regulations and precautions â€“ **stay safe!** <br>
